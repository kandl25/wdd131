        <h2 class="history">History</h2>
            <p>Ballet was established in the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century. Ballet eventually moved to France and became adjacent to Operas.
                Many of the performances were done by men until 1681 when the first principal female dancer came along. <br>
                Ballet then moved again to Russia in the 19th century; where many well known ballet performances, many know today, came from. These performances are "Swan Lake",
                "The Nutcracker", and "Sleeping Beauty". A prostegious ballet company emerged and began traveling the world to share the beauty of ballet. <br>
                With this show of ballet, Europe and North America joined the trend of having their own ballet companies. Many of these companies still operate today and have been
                around since the mid 1900's.
