            <h2>About Kaylee</h2>
            <img class="couple" src="images/kaylee-luke.jpg" alt="Luke and Kaylee">
            <p>   
                    My name is Kaylee DeCamps. I was born and raised in Idaho but lived everywhere in the Treasure Valley, which is the state captial to
                 the Oregon border. I have six siblings and I am the oldest. Growing up I was able to travel a bit; when I was a kid we would go the 
                 Lagoon in Farmington, Utah. We would go there for dance competitions every summer. In high school I went to Puerto Rico for a dance 
                 trip, when I graduated high school I moved to Ketchikan, Alaska to work for the summer. After that I lived in Las Vegas, Nevada for 
                 two years working as a nanny. Since then I have been in Rexburg, Idaho, and met the love of my life.

                    Luke and I have been married for a year. We are both in school and working full time. Marriage has been so amazing and hard, sometimes 
                 all at the same time. For only being married a year we have already had a life threatening experience. I suffered with migraines for 
                 a month and come to find out the cause of my migraines was a rare type of blood clotting in my brain. The blood clots were so bad I 
                 ended up having a small stroke the day I was diagnosed. I am still healing but feeling much better and getting stronger everyday.
                
                    Now, Luke and I have a little baby girl named Knives! She is a 6 month old hedgehog who loves to sleep all, eat food, and is the sweetest cuddler.
                 She is the best addition to our family and love this cute little sweety.
